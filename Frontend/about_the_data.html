        <h2>Why This Data?</h2>
            <p>We chose this dataset through our mutual curiosity in the energy production of the United States. 
                The US Department of Energy maintains records of each States monthly/quarterly energy generation
                from 2001 through 2021, and their specific categories of production. We decided limit the amount of 
                data we would be working with by focusing on 2021's energy output.</p>
                
            <p>In order to collect the data, we downloaded a CSV containing the monthly energy production of each state in 
                2021. Of course, this data required cleaning and organizing to suit our project needs. The first change
                we made to our dataset was to swap the column labels. Previously, the columns were time followed by
                state name and category of production. For example, the connections of January and Wisconsin, Solar
                power would indicate the amount of energy (in Kilowatt Hours) generated via Solar means during Jan.
                in Wisconsin. This format was not very readable, so we 'swapped' the rows and columns. Our columns
                then became: Location, Category of Production, January, ... , December. We found this format made
                more intuitive sense and was more readable.</p>
